# 🤖 GitHub Copilot Agent — Feature-to-PR Template

> **Optimized for GitHub Copilot agents on github.com and in VS Code**  
> Execute as ONE autonomous PR with full context awareness

---

## 🎯 Mission Statement

**Feature:** `[REQUIRED: Specific feature name]`  
**Outcome:** `[REQUIRED: 1-2 sentences describing user-visible impact]`  
**Scope Level:** `[SELECT ONE: 🔵 Small | 🟢 Medium | 🔴 Large]`

> ⚠️ **STOP**: If any `[REQUIRED]` field above contains placeholders, **ASK** for clarification before proceeding.

---

## 🧭 Core Principles

### 1. **Context-First Execution**
- Always begin with **Step 0: Context Scan**
- Use existing repo patterns (don't invent new ones)
- Respect `.github/copilot-instructions.md` and related docs

### 2. **Clarify Before Coding**
- If **anything** is ambiguous → **Ask up to 5 targeted questions**
- Questions should be:
  - ✅ Specific and actionable
  - ✅ Necessary to prevent rework
  - ❌ Not about trivial naming or formatting

### 3. **Reviewable Changes**
- **One PR only** — no "Part 1 of 3"
- Keep diffs focused and logical
- If scope expands significantly → **Ask** if it should be split

### 4. **Quality Gates Match Scope**
- 🔵 **Small** (bug fixes, typos, minor tweaks): Tests + docs + build passes
- 🟢 **Medium** (new features, API endpoints): All 🔵 + edge cases + security review + integration tests
- 🔴 **Large** (architecture changes, new services): All 🟢 + ADR + observability + performance testing + rollback plan

## 🔄 Required Workflow

### **Step 0: Context Scan** *(Must do first)*

Run these checks and document findings:

#### 0.1 — Repository Configuration
```bash
# Build/test/lint commands
Check: package.json, Makefile, .github/workflows/*
Find: How to build, test, lint, and run locally
```

#### 0.2 — Existing Patterns
For each of these, find **1-2 example files** to use as templates:

| Pattern | What to Find | Where to Look |
|---------|--------------|---------------|
| **Auth** | How is user identity verified? Middleware? Decorators? | Backend functions, API routes |
| **Validation** | Zod? Joi? Manual checks? | Form components, API handlers |
| **Error Handling** | Error classes? Status codes? User messages? | Try/catch blocks, error boundaries |
| **Logging** | What library? What levels? Structured or plain text? | Console.log calls, logger imports |
| **State Management** | Context? Redux? Zustand? React Query? | Hooks, providers |
| **Styling** | Tailwind? CSS Modules? Styled Components? | Component files |
| **Testing** | Jest? Vitest? Testing Library? Cypress? | Test files, test config |

#### 0.3 — Find Reference Implementation
- **For new API endpoint** → Find most similar existing endpoint
- **For new UI component** → Find most similar existing component
- **For new utility function** → Find similar utility
- **List 2-3 files** to use as structural templates

#### 0.4 — CI/CD Constraints
```bash
# Check for:
- Required status checks (.github/workflows/*)
- Branch protection rules
- CODEOWNERS file
- Signed commits requirement
```

**📝 OUTPUT**: Post a summary of findings before proceeding to Step 1

---

### **Step 1: Plan** *(Post before major edits)*

Create a brief plan with:

#### 1.1 — Files to Change
```
- src/components/NewFeature.jsx (NEW)
- src/api/feature-endpoint.js (MODIFY)
- src/hooks/useFeature.js (NEW)
- README.md (MODIFY - document new feature)
- package.json (MODIFY - add dependency X)
```

#### 1.2 — Implementation Strategy
- What's the high-level approach?
- What existing patterns/components will you reuse?
- Any new dependencies needed? Why?

#### 1.3 — Test Plan
```
Unit Tests:
- Test A validates input handling
- Test B validates success path
- Test C validates error cases

Integration Tests (if applicable):
- Test D validates end-to-end flow
```

#### 1.4 — Rollback Plan
- How to safely revert if issues arise?
- Feature flag? Database migration rollback? Simple git revert?

#### 1.5 — Risk Assessment
- **Risk Level**: [Low/Medium/High]
- **Known Risks**: [List 1-3]
- **Mitigations**: [How you'll address each]

**📝 OUTPUT**: Wait for approval/feedback before proceeding to implementation

### **Step 2: Implement**

#### Code Quality Checklist
- [ ] Follow existing code style (linter config)
- [ ] Use TypeScript types if repo uses TS
- [ ] Add JSDoc comments for public APIs
- [ ] Keep functions small and single-purpose
- [ ] Extract magic numbers to named constants
- [ ] No hardcoded credentials or secrets
- [ ] Defensive: Check for null/undefined before using

#### Security Checklist
- [ ] **Input Validation**: Validate all user inputs at trust boundaries
- [ ] **Authorization**: Server-side checks for protected operations (never client-only)
- [ ] **Output Encoding**: Escape user content in UI to prevent XSS
- [ ] **Secrets**: Use environment variables, never commit tokens
- [ ] **Dependencies**: Check for known vulnerabilities (`npm audit`)

#### Performance Checklist
- [ ] No unnecessary re-renders (React: useMemo, useCallback)
- [ ] No N+1 queries (batch database calls)
- [ ] Lazy load heavy components/images
- [ ] Add loading states for async operations

---

### **Step 3: Tests**

#### Test Coverage Requirements
- **🔵 Small**: At least 1 test proving the fix works
- **🟢 Medium**: Success path + 2-3 edge cases + 1-2 error cases
- **🔴 Large**: All happy paths + comprehensive edge cases + performance tests

#### Test Quality Checklist
- [ ] Tests are deterministic (no random data, no real timers)
- [ ] Tests are isolated (no shared state between tests)
- [ ] Tests document behavior (readable test names)
- [ ] Mock external dependencies (APIs, databases)
- [ ] Use repo's existing test patterns and utilities

#### Example Test Structure
```javascript
describe('NewFeature', () => {
  describe('Success Cases', () => {
    it('should handle valid input correctly', () => {
      // Arrange, Act, Assert
    });
  });

  describe('Edge Cases', () => {
    it('should handle empty input gracefully', () => {});
    it('should handle maximum length input', () => {});
  });

  describe('Error Cases', () => {
    it('should display error message on API failure', () => {});
  });
});
```

---

### **Step 4: Documentation**

#### Required Documentation
- [ ] **README.md**: Update if feature is user-visible or changes setup
- [ ] **Code Comments**: Explain "why" not "what" (what is obvious from code)
- [ ] **API Docs**: Update OpenAPI/Swagger if API changes
- [ ] **Inline Examples**: Add usage examples for complex APIs
- [ ] **Migration Guide**: If breaking change, explain how to upgrade

#### Optional Documentation (if applicable)
- [ ] **ADR**: Architecture Decision Record for significant architectural choices
- [ ] **CHANGELOG.md**: Add entry if repo maintains one
- [ ] **Runbook**: For ops-heavy features (monitoring, incidents)
- [ ] **Diagrams**: Architecture or sequence diagrams for complex flows

## 🚨 Troubleshooting Guide

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| **CI fails on unrelated tests** | Document in PR; consider if your change could have side effects |
| **Merge conflicts appear** | Rebase onto latest main: `git pull --rebase origin main` |
| **Scope grows during implementation** | **STOP** and ask: "This is expanding to include X. Should this be a separate PR?" |
| **No existing test infrastructure** | **Ask**: "This repo has no tests. Should I set up testing (Vitest/Jest) or skip?" |
| **Dependency unavailable in tests** | Mock it; document in "Known Limitations" |
| **Performance concern** | Measure with profiler; document findings; add performance test |
| **Security vulnerability in new dep** | **Ask**: "Dependency X has vulnerability Y. Acceptable risk or find alternative?" |

## 🎓 Agent Learning Notes

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
1. **Don't guess patterns** — always check existing code first
2. **Don't skip Step 0** — context scan prevents rework
3. **Don't over-engineer** — match existing complexity level
4. **Don't ignore CI failures** — they're trying to tell you something
5. **Don't mix concerns** — one PR = one logical change

### Signs You Should Ask Questions
- Multiple ways to implement something and no clear "right" way
- Security implications you're unsure about
- Performance impact that's hard to estimate
- Breaking changes that might affect users
- Scope that feels too large for one PR

### Signs You're on the Right Track
- Your plan closely mirrors an existing feature
- You're reusing existing components/utilities
- Build and lint are passing locally
- Code diff is focused and readable
- You can explain the rollback plan clearly

---

## 📞 Need Help?

If stuck or unsure:
1. **Check documentation**: README.md, package.json, existing code
2. **Look for similar code**: Find reference implementation
3. **Ask specific questions**: "Should I use pattern A or B?" not "What should I do?"
4. **Propose a solution**: "I'm planning X because Y. Thoughts?" gets faster feedback
